Simple recreation of hit TV show "Are You The One", where group of contestents are secretly matched, and they are tasked with correctly parterning up. 
After each round of partnering they are able to select one pair to test in the booth, and are told the total correct number of pairs. 

Goal of this project was two fold, create a matchmaking algorithem (Which I wish I did more with), and 3 algorithems to try playing the game.

The algorithems are one that relies on pure randomness to match, one that relies on checking a pair and removing them from the pool of possible matches
if they are corrrectly matched. And finally one that swaps a pair, and sees how the total number of pairs change to more quikly deduce the correct pairs.

Algorithems for the most part work semi decently, although missing the communication aspect of the game which was planned to be implemented but wasnt. 

Run python main.py, select how many contestents, and how many trials, and it will give you the averaged rounds and running time it took to solve.
